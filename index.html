                        <p>
                                In certain games, the player must find and unlock new abilities in order to progress
                                through the game. These abilities are often obtained by completing certain tasks or finding
                                hidden items.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                In this tutorial, we will set up the foundation for unlocking abilities. Once an ability is
                                unlocked, the ability must remain unlocked throughout the lifespan of the game. The <b>WorldBool</b>
                                component will be crucial for this to work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                In your player controller, add the WorldBool component.
                        </p>

                        <div class="horizontal">
                                <img src="assets/unlockAbility.png" class="imageBorder" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                The WorldBool is used for saving. In order for this to save correctly, enabled the Save option,
                                give the Name ID a unique name, and initialize its Value to false. You can also clear any saved
                                data by pressing the trash icon located in the Save section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                We will take advantage of the fact that each ability can be paused, and calling the Pause
                                method on any ability will set this state. For convenience, press the pause icon (which will turn red)
                                on any ability to pause it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Drag and drop the player object into each On Load event,
                                choose the Jump Ability for example, and select the Pause method. This can be applied
                                to any ability. It can also be applied to the FireArm and Melee classes (on the next Flare update, 1.7.2).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Anytime the game begins, the On Load Condition True will be called if the WorldBool Value is True, and
                                this will set the Pause method to False, which will unpause (or unlock) the ability. For Load Condition False,
                                this event will be called if the WorldBool Value is False, and this will set the Pause method to
                                True, which will pause the ability.
                        </p>
                        <div class="horizontal">
                                <img src="assets/unlockDoubleJump.png" class="imageBorder" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                This example shows how to unlock the double jump ability. Since the double jump exists
                                within the Jump Ability, it can't use the Pause method. Instead, we set the number of air jumps directly
                                by calling the SetAirJump method.
                        </p>

                        <p class="noteBoxes type2">
                                Tip: if you have too many abilities to unlock, you can place as many WorldBool components on a separate
                                game object to organize.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                Now, the only thing that remains is to set the WorldBool's Value to True. The scenario in which this happens
                                will be highly dependent on each game. It can be done through AI or by picking up an Item. The important
                                part is to call the SetTrue method on the WorldBool. It's also very important that you call the ability
                                you want to unlock simultaneously, or else the ability won't activate until the scene resets.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                In the example above, the player can already jump and I make use of an AIFSM. As soon as the player enters the territory
                                it will unlock the player's double jump ability. If you exit and enter playmode again, you'll be able to double jump immediately.
                                Check out the image below to see how I set up the AIFSM. If you are working with AIFSM for the first time,
                                please refer to the docs or youtube tutorials for more information.
