                <h2> Unlock Ability</h2>

                <p>
                        In certain games, the player must find and unlock new abilities in order to progress
                        through the game. These abilities are often obtained by completing certain tasks or finding
                        hidden items, and they allow the player to access new areas and defeat tougher enemies.
                </p>

                <p>
                        In this tutorial, we will set up the foundation for unlocking abilities in the game.
                        Initially, the player will have a limited set of abilities and eventually gain more as the
                        game progress. Once an ability is unlocked, the ability must remain unlocked throughout the
                        lifespan of the game, regardless of game level or wether the game is turned off. The
                        <b>WorldBool</b> component will be crucial for this to work.
                </p>

                <h4> The Setup</h4>

                <p>
                        In your player controller, include the WorldBool component.
                </p>
