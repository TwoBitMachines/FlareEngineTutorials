                <h2> Unlock Ability</h2>

                <p>
                        In certain games, the player must find and unlock new abilities in order to progress
                        through the game. These abilities are often obtained by completing certain tasks or finding
                        hidden items, and they allow the player to access new areas and defeat tougher enemies.
                </p>

                <p>
                        In this tutorial, we will set up the foundation for unlocking abilities in the game. The
                        <b>WorldBool</b> component is crucial for this to work. The concept of unlocking abilities
                        involves starting the game with a limited set of abilities and eventually
                        gaining more as the player progresses. Once an ability is unlocked, it must be retained for
                        the duration of the game, no matter which level the player is on or if the game has been
                        turned off. The setup we create will ensure that all unlocked abilities are remembered
                        throughout the entire lifespan of the game.
                </p>

                <h4> The Setup</h4>

                <p>
                        In your player controller, include the WorldBool component. The initial setup will also
                        require to contain an ability that will later be activated. 3
