                        <h2> Unlock Ability</h2>

                        <p>
                                In certain games, the player must find and unlock new abilities in order to progress
                                through the game. These abilities are often obtained by completing certain tasks or finding
                                hidden items.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                This tutorial will show you how to set up the foundation for unlocking abilities. It is important
                                that once an ability is unlocked, it remains unlocked throughout the lifespan of the game.
                                The WorldBool component is crucial for this to work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                To get started, add the WorldBool component to your player controller.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                                <img src="assets/unlockAbility.png" class="imageBorder" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                The WorldBool component is used for saving. To use it correctly, enable the Save option,
                                give it a unique Name ID, and initialize its Value to false. You can also clear any saved
                                data by pressing the trash icon in the Save section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                We can use the fact that each ability can be paused by calling the Pause method on it. For
                                convenience, you can press the pause icon (which will turn red) to pause an ability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                To apply this to the Jump Ability, for example, drag and drop the player object into each
                                On Load event and select the Pause method. This can be applied to any ability, as well as the
                                FireArm and Melee classes (with Flare 1.7.2).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                When the game starts, the On Load Condition True event will be called if the Value is
                                True, and this will set the Pause method to False, which will unlock the ability. Otherwise,
                                the On Load Condition False event will be called and the Pause method will be set
                                to True, which will pause the ability.
                        </p>

                        <p class="noteBoxes type2">
                                Important: Since each ability must be unlocked or locked in every scene, this means this setup must
                                exist in each scene, and each WorldBool must have the exact same settings. Typically, this should
                                be part of the player prefab.
                        </p>

                        <div class="horizontal">
                                <img src="assets/unlockDoubleJump.png" class="imageBorder" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                This example shows how to unlock the double jump ability. Since the double jump is part of the Jump Ability,
                                it can't use the Pause method. Instead, we can set the number of air jumps directly by calling the SetAirJump method.
                        </p>

                        <p class="noteBoxes type2">
                                Tip: If you have a lot of abilities to unlock, you can place multiple WorldBool components on a separate game object
                                to keep them organized.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                The only thing left to do is set the WorldBool value to True. The specific scenario in which this happens will
                                depend on your game. It could be triggered by AI or by picking up an Item. <b>The important part is to call the SetTrue
                                        method on the WorldBool</b>. It's also important to call the ability you want to unlock at the same time, or else
                                the ability won't activate until the scene resets.
                        </p>

                        <div class="horizontal">
                                <img src="assets/unlockDoubleJump.gif" class="imageBorder" alt="">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                In the example above, the player has the jump ability already enabled and I use an AIFSM. When the player enters the territory,
                                it will unlock the player's double jump ability. If you exit and enter play mode again, you'll be able to double
                                jump immediately. See the image below to see how I set up the AIFSM. If you are new to AIFSM, refer to the
                                documentation or YouTube tutorials for more information.
